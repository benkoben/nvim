# nvim

This repostitory is used by me to keep track of my neovim configuration. Since my configuration is used across multiple different platforms (primarily Linux & MacOS) my config uses plugins such as `Mason` which are suitable for this particular requirement.


Use the following command to clone and install the configuration

```
git clone git@github.com:benkoben/nvim.git:~/.configs/nvim
```
