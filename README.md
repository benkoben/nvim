# nvim

This repostitory is used by me to keep track of my neovim configuration. My configuration is used across multiple different platforms (primarily Linux & MacOS).


Use the following command to clone and install the configuration

```
git clone git@github.com:benkoben/nvim.git ~/.config/nvim
```

TODO
- [ ] Migrate away from Packer and use native package management instead
